#### _calculate the duration of your open-reel audio_

### About

The duration of open-reel audio depends on several variables, and as such, is not straightforward to calculate! **reel time** is here to help with that.

Input the characteristics of your audio tapesâ€”audio config, tape thickness, recording speed, and quantityâ€”to determine their duration.

**reel time** is multilingual:  
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· Disponible en franÃ§ais et italien aussi!  
ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Disponibile in italiano e francese anche!

**reel time** is inspired by open-source preservation tools like [ffmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/), [Cable Bible](https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible/), and [SourceCaster](https://datapraxis.github.io/sourcecaster/), and of course also the [Open Reel Audio Duration Calculator](https://www.avpreserve.com/open-reel-audio-duration-calculator/) spreadsheet by Joshua Ranger of [AVPreserve](https://www.avpreserve.com/).

Suggestions and contributions are welcome! I'm happy to receive feature requests, bug reports, code changes, translations, general comments, etc. You can submit a github issue (or pull request), or [email me](mailto:kfnagels@gmail.com) directly.
